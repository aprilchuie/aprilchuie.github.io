			<section id="user-interviews">
				<h2>User Interviews</h2>

				<!--Summary about the importance of user interviews and the types of questions asked.  Be short and to the point.-->

				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RUk3Pq0fyefXY3DJJG96sdAwjxiWA15dZzAR4TOgW3c/edit?usp=sharing" target="_new"><img src="https://aprilchuie.github.io/reflections/user-interview-screenshot.png"></a>
				<p>Before even starting to design my portfolio, I conducted user interviews as a way to kind of elicit requirements. I was able to interview a diverse audience, including undergraduate computer science students, a product designer, an informatics professor, and the Director of Communications for the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Claifornia, Irvine. Having a diverse audience helped me to figure out what different types of users would expect from my portfolio. The qualities that stood out the most to me were uniqueness, storytelling, and personality. Thus I aimed to incorporate them in my own portfolio.</p>

			<section id="competitor-analysis">
				<h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>

				<!--Summary about what a competitor analysis is and the types of competitors reviewed and why you reviewed them. Be short and to the point.-->

				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OeMCtwf6w2oUMTccgWKgKlp_ZYhad4n9uSlUU9mMcf0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_new"><img src="https://aprilchuie.github.io/reflections/competitor-analysis-screenshot.png"></a>
				<p>As a second step, I completed a competitor analysis document in which I looked at different visual portfolios and user interface/experience company websites to observe what kinds of features they included as well as what I liked and disliked about each website. This allowed me to realize how important my aesthetic and color scheme would be in my own portfolio. Taking a look at websites for individual designers as well as companies and service providers helped me read into their marketing strategies and think about what I can do differently to make my portfolio stand out.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="feature-value-matrix">
				<h2>Feature Value Matrix</h2>

				<!--Summary about what a feature value matrix is and why you selected these features. Be short and to the point.-->

				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReKiY5i8oXZGyOELGv2-zgM9yWXk0lSeAlDog6GQdkY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_new"><img src="https://aprilchuie.github.io/reflections/feature-value-matrix-screenshot.png"></a>
				<p>Completing a feature value matrix allowed me to jot down what exactly I would use and include in my portfolio, along with details in how I would implement everything. I also estimated the difficulty and worth of implementing each feature. The features I included reflect the essential purpose of my portfolio, which is to showcase myself and my work through a unique visual website, as well as general qualities that make a website great, such as navigability and an intuitive layout and design flow.</p>

			<section id="feature-prioritization">
				<h2>Feature Prioritization</h2>

				<!--Summary about how you prioritized the features and how this can be incorporated into building an interface. Be short and to the point.-->

				<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Nn5_dzG3INg3993ycdef0rGaQSVExN6UPVjd1v_bjlo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_new"><img src="https://aprilchuie.github.io/reflections/feature-prioritization-screenshot.png"></a>
				<p>Prioritizing which features I would include in my portfolio based on my feature value matrix helped me to take the process of actually building my portfolio one step at a time. During implementation I focused first on features with high priority, then on features with lower and lower priority. I also generated a Kano model to help visualize a graphical version of my prioritization. The way I prioritized and estimated feature values were based on both my user interviews and competitor analysis; I tried my best to determine how important each feature was in the perspective of my audience and myself, along with how difficult or how long it would take to impelment each feature. Features with higher importance and lower implementation difficulty would be higher in priority.</p>

			<section id="user-stories">
				<h2>User Stories</h2>

				<!--Summary about the importance of user stories and how you arrived at creating them.  Be short and to the point.-->

				<p>After constructing my portfolio, I came up with various user stories that regard different goals for different types of users viewing my portfolio. I thought a lot about the different types of users that would be viewing my portfolio, which were mainly hiring managers, recruiters, other designers, and design students, looking to hire, recruit, collaborate, and learn, respectively. My user stories helped me pin point certain content pieces I was missing or which parts of my portfolio I could modify.</p>

			<section id="cognitive-walkthrough">
				<h2>Cognitive Walkthrough</h2>

				<!--Summary about what a cognitive walkthrough is and why it is important. Talk about any challenges faced while conducting them.  Be short and to the point.-->

				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ipfhttdAge8ipvy6vlG8-vqhD9UN59_cYYe6VVUyMR4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_new"><img src="https://aprilchuie.github.io/reflections/cognitive-walkthrough-screenshot.png"></a>
				<p>Next I inquired three different people about their impressions of my portfolio as they viewed the website in person. One main comment I received was that when first visiting my portfolio, the user was able to infer that the website was a professional website for an individual, such as a visual resume or design portfolio, but they were uncertain about what exact type of work would be presented. Conducting these cognitive walkthroughs helped open my mind to different ways people may think regarding how to navigate through my website and where they might look to find specific types of information. Luckily due to the simplicity of my layout and design, I was fairly successful in presenting the information I had. </p>

			<section id="user-tests">
				<h2>User Tests</h2>

				<!--Summary about the types of tests conducted and why you chose them. Make sure to include any challenges faced.  You can summarize the test results as well. Be short and to the point.-->

				<p>I conducted two particular usability tests on UsabilityHub.com: a first impressions test and a preference test.</p>

				<h3>First Impressions Test</h3>
				<a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/3d6212d267a9/results/b021923a0b6e" target="_new"><img src="https://aprilchuie.github.io/reflections/first-impressions-screenshot.png"></a>
				<p>The first impressions test alloted the user to view my portfolio website for only five seconds, and then asked the user about their first impression and what stood out most to them. I chose to conduct a first impressions test to see how successful I would be in presenting information in a concise manner and in engaging the user to stay on my website to view more content. I was afraid my desing might seem bland to other people, but I got a lot of positive comments about my dog illustration and the color scheme I used.</p>

				<h3>Preference Test</h3>
				<a href="https://usabilityhub.com/tests/498b921612a8/results/38e2e6d3cf15" target="_new"><img src="https://aprilchuie.github.io/reflections/preference-test-screenshot.png"></a>
				<p>The preference test presented the user two design options of which they were to choose which one they liked better. The first design option I thought about was a horizontal bar at the top for my main navigation. The second option I considered was a full page display for the main navigation. I initially considered keeping a horizontal navigation bar fixed at the top so that users could click to different sections no matter where they are on the page, but the full page navigation display received a 100% success rate. In the end, I liked the full page design better as it looks cleaner and more unified.</p>

				<h1>Summary of Findings</h1>

				<!--Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of your findings.  Be sure to include insights from conducting your research and tests as well as any challenges faced.  If you are not quite sure of what conclusions can be drawn, pose a hypothesis as to possible solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved.-->

				<p>Going through the process of conducting user research and tests to build my website definitely opened my mind to the fact that my portfolio is much more than just somewhere to drop off images of my design work. I realized how much goes into the meaning of each bit of content and how it affects the user experience. Overall I received a fair amount of positive feedback on my portfolio, though I do still have a lot of changes to make.</p>

				<p>One thing I struggled a lot with was representing myself throughout my portfolio while finding a nice balance between professionalism and personality. A lot of people liked how I incorporated my personality with a more subtle approach. When developing my portfolio I did focus more on the uniqueness and personality of it, as mentioned in my user interviews. However, I still feel that I can present myself more throughout the site, whether it be through my wording or more graphical content that incorporates my interests.</p>

				<p>Another struggle I faced was figuring out how to structure my work. I had initially thought about making a multi-page portfolio so that each project would be on a separate page, but I decided to keep it simple and stick with a single-page design. When presenting my projects, I wanted a way to describe them instead of just showing an ambiguous visual. Thus I thinkered around with different formatting for containers and ended up with a "card" feel that displays an icon with a short description of the project.</p>

				<h1>Incorporation of Findings</h1>

				<!--Place in at least 2-3 paragraphs of how you incorporated findings and/or how you plan to incorporate findings.  Be sure to include any challenges faced and how you arrived at solutions.  The idea is to capture how the process has helped in your understanding of how your interface can be improved and you actually took steps or plant to take steps to improve it.-->

				<p>The oustanding critique I received on my portfolio was that at first glance, the user was able to infer that my website was a personal site to showcase work, but they were unable to discern what type of work they should expect. Thus I must try to find a way to incorporate a short description or title underneath my name that mentions my interest in UX/UI design.</p>

				<p>Originally I implemented the design with a horizontal navigation display, but after receiving feedback from the preference test, I changed it to the full page display. I actually like it better myself, as it has a more focused and clean aesthetic, which is what I was trying to go for in the first place.</p>

				<p>The main changes I would still like to make to my portfolio are specifically regarding the "Work" section. I realized that hiring managers are most likely interested in pin-pointing what skills I posess, and users in general may be interested in the way I work. Thus when explaining my work experience and specific projects, I will incorporate a way -- possibly an iframe in a modal -- to elaborate on my design process along with specific struggles I encountered and how I overcame them. Another big comment I received was about the "work cards" I implemented when presenting my projects; the cards didn't seem to flow with the aesthetic and didn't give a consistent feel with the rest of the website. One idea I have right now is to change the "card" to make it seem more like paper, since I mentioned that I like Japanese stationery in my "About" section. That way I can continue to subtly incorporate myself and my interests in my design.</p>
